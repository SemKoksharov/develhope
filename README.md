## About Me

I have always been passionate about computers! I successfully completed an intensive Java backend developer course where I acquired solid skills and feel confident in my abilities. I am proficient with the Spring framework and familiar with application architecture, including REST APIs. I continuously strive to improve by attending lessons and update courses. Although I am still honing my teamwork skills, I am motivated to grow in this area and become a collaborative and effective team member.
